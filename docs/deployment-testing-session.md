# AdAgent Deployment & Testing Session

**Date:** December 2024  
**Session Type:** API Gateway Deployment & End-to-End Testing  
**Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL

## Overview

This session documented the successful deployment of the AdAgent FastAPI server on EC2 with API Gateway providing HTTPS access, and comprehensive testing of all major endpoints through the React client interface.

## Deployment Architecture

- **Backend:** FastAPI server on EC2 instance
- **Frontend:** React app deployed on AWS Amplify
- **API Gateway:** HTTPS proxy with individual endpoint configurations
- **Security:** IAM roles, security groups, HTTPS termination

## Key Deployment Decisions

### API Gateway Configuration
- **Rejected:** Proxy resource `{proxy+}` (caused internal server errors)
- **Adopted:** Individual explicit endpoints for each API route
- **Integration Type:** HTTP_PROXY (known to work reliably)
- **Endpoints Created:**
  - `/` (root)
  - `/health`
  - `/docs`
  - `/agent/*`
  - `/chat/*`
  - `/parse`
  - `/plan`
  - `/segments`
  - `/preferences/*`

### Environment Variables
- **Critical:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set in Amplify environment
- **Profile:** Using `AdAgentServer` AWS profile for deployment
- **Naming:** Consistent naming conventions for all AWS resources

## Testing Results

   - Response: 200 OK

3. **`/segments`** - Audience segment data
   - Status: Working
   - Response: JSON with segment information

4. **`/agent/status`** - Agent workflow status
   - Status: Working
   - Response: Current step, progress, avatar state

5. **`/preferences/{advId}`** - Advertiser preferences
   - Status: Working
   - Response: Network, genre, device preferences

    - Response: Reset to initial state
    - Test: Reset workflow button worked

### üîÑ Partially Tested

- **`/chat/summary`** - Chat conversation summary
  - Status: API exists but no UI integration
  - Test Method: Browser console or curl

- **`/chat/reset`** - Chat-only reset
  - Status: API exists but no UI integration
  - Test Method: Browser console or curl

### ‚ùì Not Yet Tested

- **`/docs`** - FastAPI documentation endpoint
- **`/agent/reset`** - Agent reset (different from workflow reset)

## Client-Side Testing

### UI Components Tested

1. **Campaign File Upload** ‚úÖ
   - File selection and upload
   - Campaign brief parsing
   - Button state management

2. **Chat Interface** ‚úÖ
   - Message sending and receiving
   - AI responses
   - Workflow triggering

3. **Workflow Progression** ‚úÖ
   - Step-by-step advancement
   - Progress tracking
   - State synchronization

4. **Campaign Planning** ‚úÖ
   - Plan generation
   - Data display
   - Download functionality

5. **Reset Functionality** ‚úÖ
   - Workflow reset
   - State clearing
   - UI refresh

## Issues Resolved

### API Gateway Configuration
- **Problem:** Proxy resource caused internal server errors
- **Solution:** Individual explicit endpoints with HTTP_PROXY integration
- **Result:** All endpoints now working reliably

### Environment Variables
- **Problem:** Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Amplify
- **Solution:** Set environment variable in Amplify console
- **Result:** Chat interface working properly

### SSH Key Configuration
- **Problem:** SSH key not properly configured for EC2 access
- **Solution:** Updated deployment script with correct key usage
- **Result:** Successful server deployment and management

## Deployment Scripts

### Key Scripts Used
- `scripts/deploy_ec2_with_api_gateway.sh` - Main deployment script
- `scripts/destroy_ec2_with_api_gateway.sh` - Cleanup script
- `deploy-client.sh` - Client deployment to Amplify

### Important Configuration
- AWS Profile: `AdAgentServer`
- Region: `us-east-1`
- Instance Type: `t3.micro`
- Security Groups: HTTP/HTTPS access
- API Gateway: Regional endpoint

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Monitor production usage** for any issues
2. **Set up logging** for better debugging
3. **Consider adding** the remaining endpoints to UI if needed

### Future Enhancements
1. **Performance testing** with multiple users
2. **Load balancing** if needed
3. **Database integration** for persistent data
4. **Advanced monitoring** and alerting

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Gateway proxy resources** can be unreliable - explicit endpoints are better
2. **Environment variables** must be set in both server and client environments
3. **Consistent naming** is crucial for reproducible deployments
4. **Individual endpoint testing** is more reliable than proxy testing
5. **UI integration** is essential for comprehensive testing

## Commands for Future Reference

```bash
# Deploy server
./scripts/deploy_ec2_with_api_gateway.sh

# Deploy client
./deploy-client.sh

# Test endpoints
curl -X GET "https://your-api-gateway-url/health"
curl -X POST "https://your-api-gateway-url/chat" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"test"}'

# Clean up
./scripts/destroy_ec2_with_api_gateway.sh
```
